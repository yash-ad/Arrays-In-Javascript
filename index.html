    <h1>Arrays-In-Javascript</h1>

    <h2>What is an Array?</h2>

    <p>
    Array is a basically collection of data.
    [Square Bracket] is called Literal.

    
<ol>
    <li>It has become a common practice to declare arrays using Const and always declare with Const</li>

    <li>In the square bracket we called elements likewise it could be String,Number or boolean.</li>

    <li>Array in javascript can be of mixed data types</li>

    <li>You can access elements of an array using indices 0 , 1 , 2 etc.</li>

</ol>

    </p>

    <p>Arrays are not constants :-
    The keyword Const is a little misleading. It does not define a constant array , it defines a constant reference to an array. Becuase of this , we can still change the elements of a constant Array.
     Lets take an example :- 

     Const myArray = [ 1 , 2  , 3 , 4 , 5 ];
     const array = myArray;

     array[5] = 6;

console.log(array);
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Arrays are mutable and Arrays can be changed.</li>

    <li>Strings are immutable,Strings cannot be changed.</li>

    <li>Array can hold many values under in a single name.</li>

    <li>In an Array the length is always start from 1 and array index starts from 0.</li>


</ul>



<h2>Array Properties and Methods :- </h2>
<p>The real strength of Javascript arrays are the built in array properties and methods :- 
    <ol>
        <li>1.toString():>
            Converts an array to a string of comma seperated values.
        </li>
    
        <li>2.Join():>
            Joins all the array elements using a seperator.

        </li>

        <li>Pop():>
            Removes the last element of an array and returns the removed element.
        </li>

        <li>Push():>
            Adds a new element to the end of an array and it modifies the original array with an argument, returms the new array.
        </li>


        <li>Shift():>
            Removes the first element of an array and returns it.
        </li>


        <li>Unshift():>
            Adds a new element to the beginning of an array and returns new length.

        </li>


        <li>Delete():>
            Delete is an operator its not a method, array elements can be deleted using the delete operator.

        </li>

        <li>Concat():>
            Used to join arrays to the given array and returns a new array however does not change an existing array.
        </li>

        <li>Sort():>
            This method is used to sort an array alphabetically , however we can sort the elements in an ascending order or a descending order with the help of an arrow function
        </li>


        <li>Reverse():>
            The reverse method reverses the order of the element in an array.The reverse() method overwrites the original array.
        </li>

        <li>Splice():>
            Splice can be used to add new items to an array and returns deleted items and it modifies the array and it cna be used as an argument.
            *There are four arguments of splice 1.Position to Add , 2.No of elements to remove , 3.Elements to be added & 4.Elements to be added.
        </li>


        <li>Slice():>
         Slices out a piece from an array it creates a new array and it doesnot modify the original array.
        </li>



    </ol>

<h1>Looping through arrays:-</h1>
<p>Arrays can be looped through using the classical javascript Forloop or through some other methods below</p>
